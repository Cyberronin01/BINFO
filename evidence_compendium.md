## 1. Land Enclosure - United Kingdom

### Legislative Evidence

**Total Scope**: 5,200+ individual enclosure bills enacted by Parliament between 1604-1914, affecting ~6.8 million acres

#### Key Acts

| Year | Act | Significance |
|------|-----|-------------|
| **1604** | Melcombe Regis and Radipole, Dorset Act (1 Jas. 1. c. 30) | First recorded enclosure by Act of Parliament |
| **1773** | Inclosure Act 1773 (13 Geo. 3. c. 81) | Formalized enclosure process; removed commoners' traditional access rights; mandated church door posting requirement |
| **1801** | General Enclosure Act | Sanctioned large-scale land reform; enabled consolidation of scattered strips; allowed enclosure of "wastes" (fens, marshes, moors) |

#### Timeline of Acceleration

- **1730-1839**: Over 4,000 enclosure bills passed
- **1760-1819**: 3,828 enclosure Acts (peak period)
- **1760-1870**: ~4,000 Acts affecting 7 million acres (~1/6 of England's total area)

### Impact Data

- **By end of 19th century**: Nearly all communal land in England privatized
- **Displacement**: Created wage labor force for Industrial Revolution
- **Legal Framework**: Property rights superseded traditional commons access

### Constitutional Basis

- Based on parliamentary supremacy (UK has no written constitution)
- Private Enclosure Acts passed case-by-case
- Established precedent: legislated property rights > customary usage rights

## 2. Standard Oil - United States

### Market Share Documentation

| Year | Refining Market Share | Source |
|------|----------------------|--------|
| **1880** | 90% of crude oil refining capacity | CATO Institute |
| **1890** | 88% of refined oil flows | Wikipedia / Multiple sources |
| **1904** | 91% of oil refinement, 85% of final sales | Visual Capitalist |
| **1911** (Breakup) | 64% of refining market | CATO / Supreme Court records |

**Note**: Market share declined from 90% to 64% between 1880-1911 due to new oil discoveries (West Texas) and competitors (Texaco, Gulf Oil, Royal Dutch/Shell entering US market)

**Oil Exploration Share (1911)**: Only 11% (focused on refining/distribution bottleneck, not production)

### Legal Framework

#### Sherman Antitrust Act (1890)

**Constitutional Basis**: Interstate Commerce Clause (Article I, Section 8, Clause 3, US Constitution)

**Text**:
-Section 1**: "Every contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign nations, is hereby declared to be illegal."
- **Section 2**: "Every person who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize... any part of the trade or commerce among the several States... shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor."

#### Supreme Court Ruling (1911)

**Case**: *Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States*  
**Date**: May 15, 1911  
**Decision**: Unanimous guilty verdict

**Key Findings**:
- Illegally monopolized American petroleum industry
- Violated Sherman Antitrust Act
- Ordered dissolution into 33-34 independent companies within 6 months
- Established "rule of reason" doctrine: only "unreasonable" restraints illegal

**Ironic Outcome**: Breakup tripled John D. Rockefeller's wealth, nearly making him world's first billionaire

## 4. Cloud Computing - Global

### AWS Market Share Evolution

| Year/Period | Market Share | Revenue (where available) |
|-------------|--------------|---------------------------|
| **Q4 2014** | 30% global market | - |
| **Q3 2015** | 36.9% (up from 33.9% in Q2) | - |
| **2020** | 32% (October); 41% IaaS market | $26.2 billion revenue |
| **Q1 2024** | 31% | - |
| **Q3 2024** | 31% | - |
| **Q4 2024** | 30% | - |
| **2025 (Projection)** | 30% global cloud infrastructure | - |

**Stability**: AWS has maintained 30-36% market share for decade, despite competition from Azure, GCP

### Pricing Model & Lock-In Mechanisms

#### Egress Fee Structure (US East – N. Virginia)

**2024 Update**: Free tier increased from 1 GB → 100 GB/month (regulatory pressure for data portability)

| Data Volume | Cost per GB |
|-------------|-------------|
| First 100 GB/month | Free |
| Next 9.9 TB/month | $0.09 |
| Next 40 TB | $0.085 |
| Next 100 TB | $0.07 |
| Over 150 TB | $0.05 |

#### Cross-Region Transfer
- Most common pairings: ~$0.02/GB
- Adjacent regions (e.g., US East to US East Ohio): $0.01/GB
- **Never free**

#### Cross-Availability Zone (Same Region)
- $0.01/GB each direction = $0.02/GB total

#### To Public Internet
- Most expensive: ~$0.09/GB (first 10 TB after free tier)

**Exit Fee Elimination (2024)**: AWS announced no egress fees for customers migrating to another cloud/on-prem, if:
- Approved by AWS account team
- 60-day exit period
- Complete data/workload removal
- Facilitated through AWS credits

### Constitutional/Regulatory Context

- No specific "cloud computing" regulations in most jurisdictions
- Subject to general antitrust law (Sherman Act in US)
- GDPR Article 20 (EU) mandates data portability but doesn't limit cloud consolidation
- Market dominance maintained through technical lock-in, not legal mandate

**Date**: September 26, 2018  
**Decision**: 4:1 majority upheld Aadhaar Act, 2016 (Justice D.Y. Chandrachud dissented)

####Mandatory vs. Non-Mandatory Services

**MANDATORY** (Section 7 upheld):
- Linking with Permanent Account Number (PAN)
- Filing income tax returns
- Receiving subsidies/benefits funded from Consolidated Fund of India
- State welfare schemes

**NON-MANDATORY** (struck down):
- Bank account linking
- Mobile phone connections
- Private company services (barred from demanding Aadhaar)
- School admissions
- Examinations (CBSE, NEET, UGC)

#### Data Retention Ruling

- **Struck down**: Regulation 27 of Aadhaar (Authentication) Regulations, 2016
- **Previous**: Allowed 5-year authentication data retention
- **New limit**: Maximum 6 months

#### Constitutional Basis

**Right to Privacy**: Recognized under Article 21 of Indian Constitution (*Puttaswamy* judgment, 2017)

**Majority Opinion**: Aadhaar does not create surveillance state; minimal data collection with safeguards

**Dissent (Justice Chandrachud)**: Entire project unconstitutional; potential for surveillance and privacy breaches

---

### 6.2 Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA) 2023

**Enacted**: August 11, 2023  
**Constitutional Basis**: Article 21 (Right to Privacy) per *Puttaswamy* (2017)

#### Data Subject Rights

**Included**:
- Right to access personal data
- Right to correct data

- **Right to Data Portability**: No general right (present in 2018/2019 drafts but omitted from final Act)
- **Right to be Forgotten**: Removed from final version

#### Limited Portability via Consent Managers

- Consent managers envisioned as intermediaries
- Facilitate giving/managing/ reviewing/withdrawing consent
- Interoperable platform allows *some* data portability
- Not equivalent to GDPR Article 20 comprehensive portability

#### Constitutional Challenges

**Filed**: Digital rights organizations in Supreme Court  
**Grounds**:
- Broad government exemptions violate *Puttaswamy* standard
- Data Protection Board independence concerns
- Lack of data portability undermines informational self-determination
- Potential for arbitrary state surveillance
